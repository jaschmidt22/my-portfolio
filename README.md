# Jessica's Profile

## Description

I am currently a student learning full-stack web development. I have created this profile web page so that I can showcase my work. It is important to have examples of my work for potential employers to see. During the making of this webpage, I learned how to create a webpage from scratch. So far I have one live application, which is a code refactoring project I recently finished. I look forward to completing more projects and adding them to my profile.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This web page will be used to showcase examples of the websites that I create. It will be a way for potential employers to see what kind of work I do. As I complete more projects I will add them to my profile.

## Credits

Throughout the making of this project I referenced my class repository https://git.bootcampcontent.com/Arizona-State-University/ASU-VIRT-FSF-PT-10-2023-U-LOLC for examples when I needed help.
